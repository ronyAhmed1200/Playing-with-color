    <h1>Apple vs Burger</h1>
    <h3>Advantages of eating apple</h3>
    <p>They can improve lung health. Several studies have tied eating apples (with the skin) to better lung health, as well as a lower risk of respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. One study even found that apples helped reduce
        the risk of asthma more than other fruits and veggies combined.</p>
    <h3>Disadvantage of eating burger</h3>
    <p>Despite their deliciousness, however, burgers can contribute to weight gain and have other harmful effects on your health, especially if you go for a fast food version.</p>
